- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoleneKearse a _former ESL Teacher_ in China, and now a **self-taught developer**.  My favourite resources are **[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)**, **[Dave Gray's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode)**, **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)** and anything by **[Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)**.

- 👀 I’m interested in **Frontend Development**; doing exciting things with **CSS**, **JavaScript** & **API**'s, and now **React**! I also love making my projects as **accessible** and **responsive** as possible & learning about **UX Design**.  I just discovered **open source** via **#Hacktoberfest** and got my 4th pull request approved today on October, 5th, 2022!!!

- 🌱 I'm currently learning **React** to work on group projects. I level up my JavaScript by practicing challenges on **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)**.  As of  August 31st, 2022, I ranked up to 5 kyu! I'm also learning **SCSS** (I prefer this syntax to that of SASS).

- 📫 How to reach me => DM on Twitter: [@FromJolene](https://twitter.com/FromJolene) or LinkedIn [Jolene Kearse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolene-kearse-2562ba218/),  or you could email me at: pharaohnutz@gmail.com.

- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything and everything... I love **working on projects with teams of devs** and **pair programming** sessions.
