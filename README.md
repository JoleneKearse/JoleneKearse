- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoleneKearse a _former ESL Teacher_ in China, and now a **self-taught developer**.  My favourite resources are **[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)**, **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)** and anything by **[Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)**.

- 👀 I’m interested in **Frontend Development**; doing exciting things with **CSS**, **JavaScript** & **API**'s. I also love making my projects as **accessible** and **responsive** as possible & learning about **UX Design**.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning **SCSS** (I prefer this syntax to that of SASS), and to actually use **API**s.  I've tried and failed using them so many times, so this is such an exciting time for me! I'm working to level up my JavaScript by practicing challenges on **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)**.  As of today, August 31st, 2022, I ranked up to 5 kyu!

- 📫 How to reach me => DM on Twitter: [@FromJolene](https://twitter.com/FromJolene) or LinkedIn [Jolene Kearse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolene-kearse-2562ba218/),  or you could email me at: pharaohnutz@gmail.com.

- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything and everything... I'd love to try pair programming or work with other _'higher than complete'_ beginners!
